						<b>Quote</b><br>
						<i>"The main way to reduce stress in the workplace is by picking the right people."</i> _ Jesse Schell<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Description</b><br>
						<u>Professional:</u> A person in a workplace that needs help with a website, either from a full-time employee or through a freelance contract.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Needs</b><br>
						<ul>
							<li>The website may be in need of an update or a complete overhaul.</li>
							<li>Additionally, it may have not been written to support mobile devices, and so it needs that capability added to it.</li>
							<li>The company has changed what they want to communicate via their website, so they need to update teh site accordingly.</li>
							<li>There is a desire to shift from customer payment via PayPal to Stripe.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Frustrations</b><br>
						<ul>
							<li>Their website was written many (that is, five) years ago, and it doesn't incorporate all the latest features available through CSS.</li>
							<li>The code is not commented well, and it was written by a contract web development company. So no one at the company really understands how it works, and they don't want to invest the time understanding it if they can pay someone else to do it.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Ideal Features</b><br>
						Prompts for event posters to input detailed information, such as:
						<ul>
							<li>Date &amp; Time</li>
							<li>Venue (Address or GPS)</li>
							<li>Food? Non/organic? Vegetarian? Allergy-compatible?</li>
							<li>Entertainment</li>
							<li>Special Guests</li>
							<li>Schedule</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Scenarios</b><br>
						<ol>
							<li>They want to expand their markets to Africa, and so they want to support facebook's free basics platform.</li>
							<li></li>
							<li></li>
						</ol>
					</li>
